            <p>service is a personally tailored service where our team will be on site to assess natural lighting conditions, interior design and spatial requirements for seamless integration of plants and planters we have selected. Our on site services are not restricted to just addition of new plants. If you have existing plants that need help, we can do that too.  </p>
            <p>We are able to put together a curated collection for your home or commercial spaces based on what would work. Having worked on various projects, our experienced team is able to accommodate your needs. To help help you select the right plants and planters for your home, we offer a complimentary in store styling service where you are welcome to book in a time with our designers to select plants and planters that complement your space.</p>
            <p>We believe plants make a world of difference in any home. With cities becoming denser and more and more man made - introducing plants into your home can make a huge difference aesthetically and mentally. Plants make for a better well being.</p>
